# Background

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) can be thought of as the ocean equivalent to atmospheric heatwaves that humans often experience on land. Qualitatively, MHWs are defined as prolonged and discrete periods of extremely warm sea surface temperatures that cause damage to marine habitats and disrupt ecological functioning [@Hobday2016; @Smale2019]. As a result, MHWs have resulted in declines in fishery productivity and even economic loss [@Mills2013; @McCabe2016; @Cheung2020]. The overall persistence and spatial extent of MHWs present several management challenges to protect living marine resources and secure economies [@Pershing2019]. This issue is further complicated by the anticipation of stronger, longer lasting, and more frequent MHWs occurring as the ocean adjusts to continued emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases [@Frolicher201; @Oliver2019; @IPCC2021]. However, to fully understand the threat of MHWs evolving under future global warming scenarios, a careful inspection of the spatiotemporal connectivity of MHWs is an important prerequisite to link knowledge about the physical drivers of MHW with their time evolving patterns.
