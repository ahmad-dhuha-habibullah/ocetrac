# Background

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a type of extreme warming event in the field of oceanography that have gained increased attention since first being described off the coast of Western Australia in 2011 [@Pearce2013]. Qualitatively, MHWs are defined as prolonged and discrete periods of extremely warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) that cause thermal stress for marine ecosystems [@Hobday2016; @Smale2019]. The consequences range from coral bleaching to mass die-offs of critical marine species, harmful algal blooms, unproductive fisheries, economic loss, and even cross-border tensions [@Cheung2020; @McCabe2016; @Mills2013]. The overall long-lived persistence and large spatial scales of MHWs present several management challenges to protect living marine resources and secure economies [@Pershing2019]. These challenges are further complicated by the anticipation of stronger, longer lasting, and more frequent MHWs occurring as the ocean warms due to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [@Frolicher2018; @IPCC2021; @Oliver2019a]. To fully understand the threat of MHWs evolving under future global warming scenarios, a careful inspection of the spatiotemporal connectivity of MHWs is an important prerequisite to link the known physical drivers of MHWs with their time evolving patterns [@Holbrook2020]. 

Detection methods for MHWs are typically based on point-wise thresholding, where the time series of SST at each spatial grid point is separately analyzed [@Oliver2021]. A MHW occurs when SST at a particular location exceeds the local 90th percentile computed over a 30-year fixed climatology [@Hobday2016]. This definition has been applied to globally gridded historical and projected SSTs to assess trends in MHW metrics [@Frolicher2018; @Oliver2018; @Oliver2019a], drivers [@Holbrook2019; @SenGupt2020], and variability [@Oliver2019b]. Once MHWs are detected, their properties (e.g., intensity, duration, and frequency) are often averaged over time and evaluated as composite maps. While these approaches are useful in detecting MHWs locally, they are limited by their inability to characterize the full evolution of spatially connected and discrete events. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal connectivity of MHWs is critical to advance state-of-the-art systems for MHW prediction and forecasting.

# Summary

To overcome the complex spatiotemporal challenges of characterizing MHWs, we present the first known global detection and tracking algorithm for MHWs. By leveraging morphological operations from multidimensional image processing and multiple object tracking, `Ocetrac` provides new spatiotemporal metrics that can be probed to explore how observed and simulated events evolve. 

Applied to over 40 years of observed global SST data, @Scannell20XX use `Ocetrac` to reveal new pathways that connect geographically distant MHWs. They find that the tropical Pacific Ocean acts as a major conduit for extremely persistent and long-lived MHWs, likely generated by oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections from the tropics to mid-latitudes (e.g., @Xu2020). The composition of the detected MHWs is dependent on two parameter choices within `Ocetrac` that can be adjusted depending on feature importance and grid scale resolution. These parameters are referred to as smoothing radius and area threshold, and are explained in more detail in the example use case section. For MHW detection, @Scannell20XX recommend using a radius of 8 (for 0.25º horizontal resolution data) and an area threshold criteria equivalent to the 75th percentile. @Scannell20XX provide a systematic parameter sensitivity analysis and recommendations for different use cases.  

`Ocetrac` contains a global class called *Tracker* that includes a collection of functions designed to detect, label, track, and characterize MHW objects. The primary algorithms are implemented using the Python programming language as a wrapper around many well-established numeric packages including numpy, xarray, dask, scipy, and scikit-image. A collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ocetrac/ocetrac/tree/main/notebooks) are provided to assist users through the entire workflow.

# Statement of Need

`Ocetrac` is intended to be used as a data processing tool for the extraction of MHW trajectories past, present, and future. It provides many useful metrics such as event size, location, intensity, and duration. We anticipate that these metrics will be incorporated into machine learning forecasts to predict when and where MHWs are likely to occur, with the intent for operational use in warning vulnerable coastal communities of physical risk. 
While our work focuses on tracking MHWs, the algorithm implemented in `Ocetrac` could be applied to track any geographically coherent spatiotemporal anomalies.

# Example use case

`Ocetrac` is an analysis routine with several data processing steps. For the purposes of detecting and tracking MHWs, we analyze the NOAA monthly Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) dataset on a ¼º grid from 1981 through 2020. SST anomalies (SSTAs) are defined by removing the mean, trend, and seasonal cycle computed over the entire time period at each grid point. The 90th percentile of SSTAs is computed, again at each location over the 1981-2020 time period, and used as a threshold to identify candidate MHW grid points.

The preprocessing steps above are performed at each spatial grid point. The resulting maps are transformed into binary images where 1's signify candidate MHW points and 0's signify the background image. The goal is to identify clusters of 1's that define a MHW object and meet specific spatial characteristics in terms of structure and size. These criteria depend on user specified parameter choices (smoothing radius and area threshold).

Object detection is performed using a set of mathematical morphological operations in unique succession (closing then opening). Closing dilates a binary image before eroding it, while opening is the erosion of an image followed by a dilation. These operations are applied using the same structuring element defined by its radius from the origin. The radius represents the first user specified parameter, which could be adjusted based on the resolution of the dataset. For the ¼º OISST dataset, the default is a radius of 8 grid points or ~2º.  The structuring element should have a smaller radius for coarse resolution data, and vice versa to preserve the scale of ~200 km. The structuring element is used to scan over the entire image to manipulate features based on the dilation and erosion of the image. Erosion eliminates isolated and small features, while dilation fills small holes within larger objects and gradually enlarges the boundaries of the feature region.

The resulting MHW object contours are shown in green and compared to the original MHW candidate map. \label{fig:thr}](fig4.png)

The resulting objects form the initial set of detected MHW objects. Small objects are dropped based on their area using a percentile threshold defined from the total size distribution. This area threshold is the second user-defined parameter and should be chosen based on the phenomenon of interest. For MHW, we suggest the 75th percentile as this retains the majority of detected objects and removes small heat islands and isolated eddies. This criterion ensures that only substantially sized MHWs are identified and tracked. 


The final step in `Ocetrac` involves multiple object tracking. MHWs are defined using a 3D centrosymmetric connectivity element, such that multiple objects that are either adjacent, diagonal, or overlap in time are connected and share a unique ID. There are two possible evolutions: (1) multiple objects merge to form a single event, or (2) a single object splits into multiple objects that inherit the ID of the initial object. By design, any objects that have connectivity share an ID, allowing MHWs to contain multiple connected objects.

# External libraries used

Data manipulation is conveniently handled using `numpy` [@numpy] and `xarray` [@xarray], and are integrated with `dask` [@dask] when possible, for efficient parallelized computing. The detection algorithm uses a set of morphological operations contained within the `scipy` [@scipy] multidimensional image processing package. Detected objects are labeled and analyzed using the `scikit-image` [@scikit-image] measure module.
